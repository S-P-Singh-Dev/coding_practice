# Longest Palindromic Substring
# Difficulty: Medium
# Topic: String Manipulation
# Time: O(n^2) | Space: O(1)
#
# Approach:
# Expand around potential centers for each character and between each pair of characters. Track the maximum length found during these expansions.
#
# Solution:

        return ""
    start, end = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)
        len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)
        max_len = max(len1, len2)
        if max_len > end - start:
            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2
            end = i + max_len // 2
    return s[start:end + 1]
