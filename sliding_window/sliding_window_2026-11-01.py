# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
# Difficulty: Medium
# Topic: Sliding Window
# Time: O(n) | Space: O(min(n, m)) where n is the length of the string and m is the character set size.
#
# Approach:
# Utilize a sliding window and a hash set to keep track of the characters in the current substring. Expand the right boundary to include new characters while avoiding duplicates, and adjust the left boundary to maintain unique characters.
#
# Solution:

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    return max_length
